# This repository is created to implement Unsupervised classification of MNIST dataset using SNN
Following papers have been used as a reference:-

  1.STDP-based Unsupervised Feature Learning using Convolution-over-time in Spiking Neural Networks for 
    Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing 
    by
    GOPALAKRISHNAN SRINIVASAN, PRIYADARSHINI PANDA, and KAUSHIK ROY

  2.Unsupervised learning of digit recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasticity 
    by
    Peter U. Diehl and Matthew Cook Institute
    
## Observations so far:-
  
  1.Basic Network
    Number of input neurons : 784 (image 28x28 -> 784 x 1 vector)
    Number of hidden neurons : 0
    Number of output neurons : 10 (each neuron learning a digit)
    Classification accuracy on MNIST Test set = 32.82%
